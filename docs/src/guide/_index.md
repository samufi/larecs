This user guide provides a brief explanation of the main data types and functionality
of Larecs&#xfeff;ðŸŒ². For new users it is advisable to go through it in the order of the 
side menu.

For a deeper dive into ECS and the architecture by LarecsðŸŒ², have a look at
the [ECS FAQ](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq) by Sander Mertens, 
the author of the [Flecs ECS](http://flecs.dev/) and the 
[architecture section](https://mlange-42.github.io/arche/background/architecture/) 
of the [Arche](https://github.com/mlange-42/arche) ECS
by Martin Lange, which served as the main inspiration for LarecsðŸŒ².
