Iterating over entities can be done via 
classic `for` loops applied to [queries](#queries),
or via an [`apply`](#applying-functions-to-entities-in-queries) 
operation, which applies a given function to all entities 
conforming to a query.

## Queries

{{< api Query Queries >}} allow to iterate over all 
entities with or without a specific 
set of components. To create a query, we can use 
the {{< api World.query query >}} method of 
{{< api World >}}. The parameters used in this method are the components
that each entity we look for must have. For example, if we want to
iterate over all entities with a `Position` and a `Velocity` component,
we can do this as follows:

```mojo {doctest="guide_queries_iteration" global=true hide=true}
from larecs import World, MutableEntityAccessor, Entity
from testing import *

@value
struct Position:
    var x: Float64
    var y: Float64

@value
struct Velocity:
    var dx: Float64
    var dy: Float64
```

```mojo {doctest="guide_queries_iteration" hide=true}
world = World[Position, Velocity]()
```

```mojo {doctest="guide_queries_iteration"}
# Add entities with different components
_ = world.add_entity()
_ = world.add_entity(Position(0, 0))
_ = world.add_entity(Velocity(1, 0))
_ = world.add_entity(Position(1, 0), Velocity(1, 0))

# Query all entities that have a position
query = world.query[Position]()

# Of the entities we have just added,
# two have a position component
print(len(query)) # "2"

# Now let us iterate over the queried entities
for entity in query:
    pos = entity.get_ptr[Position]()
    print(
        "Entity at position: (" 
        + String(pos[].x) + ", " + String(pos[].y) + ")"
    )
```

Queries can be adjusted to also exclude entities that have
certain components. For example, if we want to iterate
over all entities that have a `Position` component
but not a `Velocity` component, we can do this 
using the {{< api Query.without without >}} method:

```mojo {doctest="guide_queries_iteration"}
excluding_query = world.query[Position]().without[Velocity]()
print(len(excluding_query)) # "1"
```

Furthermore, we can also query for entities that have
exactly the components we are looking for but no more.
This can be done using the {{< api Query.exclusive exclusive >}} 
method. For example, if we want to iterate
over all entities that have only a `Position` component,
we can do this as follows:

```mojo {doctest="guide_queries_iteration"}
excluding_query = world.query[Position]().exclusive()
print(len(excluding_query)) # "1"
```

> [!Note] 
> Determining the length of a query is not a trivial operation
> and may require an internal iteration if the ECS involves many components.
> Therefore, it is advisable to avoid applying the `len` function
> to queries in "hot" code. Nonetheless, the `len` function

## Iterating over queries

As we have seen, we can iterate over queries using a for loop.
Here, the control variable ("entity") is an {{< api EntityAccessor >}} 
object, i.e., not technically an {{< api Entity >}}, which is
merely an identifier of an entity. Instead, the `EntityAccessor`
directly provides methods to get, set, and check the existence
of components, so that we do not need to call the world's 
methods for this, making the code more efficient. 

```mojo {doctest="guide_queries_iteration"}
for entity in world.query[Position]():
    pos = entity.get_ptr[Position]()
    print(
        "Entity at position: (" 
        + String(pos[].x) + ", " + String(pos[].y) + ")"
    )
    if entity.has[Velocity]():
        vel = entity.get_ptr[Velocity]()
        # Also print the velocity
        print(
            " - with velocity (" 
            + String(vel[].dx) + ", " + String(vel[].dy) + ")"
        )
```

> [!Note] 
> The `EntityAccessor` is a temporary object that is
> created for each iteration. Therefore, it should not be
> stored in a container. Use {{< api EntityAccessor.get_entity >}} 
> instead if you need to store the entity for later use.

> [!Note]
> The `EntityAccessor` can be implicitly
> converted to an `Entity` object and hence be used
> wherever an `Entity` is required.

## Preventing iterator invalidation: the locked world

Adding/removing entities to/from the world 
or components to/from entities
while iterating could invalidate the iterator. That is, 
the iterator could leave out some entities or consider
some entities multiple times. 
To prevent this, LarecsðŸŒ² locks the world during iterations. 
This means that methods that change how many entities
exist in the world or which components entities have
will raise exceptions if called during iteration.

```mojo {doctest="guide_queries_iteration"}
for entity in world.query[Position]():

    # Adding entities to the world while iterating
    # is forbidden.
    with assert_raises():
        _ = world.add_entity(Velocity(1, 0)) # Raises an exception
    
    # Changing components of an entity while iterating
    # is forbidden.
    with assert_raises():
        _ = world.add(entity, Position(1, 2)) # Raises an exception
```

If we want to add or remove components from entities while iterating,
we need to store the entities in an intermediate 
container and iterate over them in
a separate loop. Consider the following example, where we
add a `Velocity` component to all entities that have a `Position`
but no `Velocity` component:

```mojo {doctest="guide_queries_iteration"}
# A container for the entities
entities = List[Entity]()
for entity in world.query[Position]().without[Velocity]():
    
    # Store the entity for later use
    # The implicit conversion to `Entity` 
    # allows us to use `entity` directly
    entities.append(entity)

# Add a velocity component to all stored entities
for entity in entities:
    # We can add components to the entity
    # because we are not iterating over the world
    _ = world.add(entity[], Velocity(1, 0))
```

> [!Note]
> In a later release, LarecsðŸŒ² will provide
> a batched version of the `add` and `remove` methods
> that will allow adding or removing components
> from multiple entities at once.


## Applying functions to entities in queries

We may want to apply a certain operation to all entities
that have certain components. This can be achieved with 
the {{< api World.apply apply >}} method. This method
iterates over all entities conforming to a query and
calls the provided function with the entities as arguments.
The function must take a {{< api MutableEntityAccessor >}} 
as its only argument. Applying a function to all entities
can be more convenient and also faster than iterating over the entities
manually, especially if the function is vectorized, as will be shown
in the [next section](#application-of-vectorized-functions).

For example, if we want to apply a function that moves all entities
with a `Position` and a `Velocity` component, we can do this as follows:

```mojo {doctest="guide_queries_iteration"}
# Define the move function
fn move(entity: MutableEntityAccessor) capturing:
    try:
        move_pos = entity.get_ptr[Position]()
        move_vel = entity.get_ptr[Velocity]()
        move_pos[].x += move_vel[].dx
        move_pos[].y += move_vel[].dy
    except:
        # We could do proper error handling here
        # but for now, we just ignore the error
        pass

# Apply the move function to all entities with a position and a velocity
world.apply[move](world.query[Position, Velocity]())
```

> [!Note] 
> Currently, the applied operation can not raise exceptions.
> Therefore, we need to catch exceptions in the function
> itself. This is due to current limitations of Mojo and
> will be changed as soon as possible.

> [!Caution]
> The world is locked during the iteration, and 
> accessing variables outside a locally defined
> function is an immature feature in Mojo. Do not
> attempt to access the `world` from inside the operation.

## Application of vectorized functions

A major advantage of Mojo is that it allows to use vectorized
operations via `SIMD`. The `apply` method allows us to 
use this feature but requires us to know the memory layout
of our components.

To showcase this feature, we need some further imports.

```mojo {doctest="guide_simd_apply" global=true}
from larecs import World, MutableEntityAccessor
from sys.info import simdwidthof
from memory import UnsafePointer
```

```mojo {doctest="guide_simd_apply" global=true hide=true}

@value
struct Position:
    var x: Float64
    var y: Float64

@value
struct Velocity:
    var dx: Float64
    var dy: Float64
```

```mojo {doctest="guide_simd_apply" hide=true}
world = World[Position, Velocity]()
_ = world.add_entities(Position(0, 0), Velocity(1, 0), count=10)
```

Before defining the vectorized operation, we need to gather some 
information about the memory layout of our components.
Specifically, we need to know how far apart the attributes

the space in memory between
two consecutive components of the same type. This is 
needed if we want to load the same attribute of multiple 
instances of the component (belonging to different entities)
at once. 

Consider our `Position` component. It has two attributes
`x` and `y`, which are both of type `Float64`. In memory,
an array of `Position` components would look like this:

```
Position[0].x | Position[0].y | Position[1].x | Position[1].y | ...
```
The space between two consecutive `x` attributes is
`2 * sizeof(Float64)`. Therefore, when loading the `x` attribute
of multiple `Position` components, we need to skip 
every other `Float64` in memory. Hence, loading the `x` attribute
of multiple `Position` components at once requires
a stride of `2`. The same applies to the `Velocity` component, 
which also has two `Float64` attributes `dx` and `dy`. 

We may store this information in `alias` variables.

```mojo {doctest="guide_simd_apply"}
alias stride = 2
```

Now we can define our vectorized move operation.
It needs to take an integer parameter `simd_width`,
which denotes how many entities will be processed at once.

```mojo {doctest="guide_simd_apply"}
fn move[simd_width: Int](entity: MutableEntityAccessor) capturing:
    
    try:
        pos = entity.get_ptr[Position]()
        vel = entity.get_ptr[Velocity]()
    except:
        return

    # Get an unsafe pointer to the memory
    # location of the Position and Velocity components
    pos_x_ptr = UnsafePointer.address_of(pos[].x)
    pos_y_ptr = UnsafePointer.address_of(pos[].y)
    vel_x_ptr = UnsafePointer.address_of(vel[].dx)
    vel_y_ptr = UnsafePointer.address_of(vel[].dy)

    # Now we load simd_width x and y attributes of the Position
    # and dx and dy attributes of the Velocity
    pos_x = pos_x_ptr.strided_load[width=simd_width](stride)
    pos_y = pos_y_ptr.strided_load[width=simd_width](stride)
    vel_x = vel_x_ptr.strided_load[width=simd_width](stride)
    vel_y = vel_y_ptr.strided_load[width=simd_width](stride)
    
    # Now we can apply the operation
    pos_x += vel_x
    pos_y += vel_y

    # Store the updated positions back to memory
    pos_x_ptr.strided_store[width=simd_width](pos_x, stride)
    pos_y_ptr.strided_store[width=simd_width](pos_y, stride)
```

What remains is to apply the move operation to all entities.
For the vectorized version, the {{< api World.apply apply >}} method
requires us to provide the `simd_width` parameter, which 
denotes the maximal number of entities that can be processed
at once. This is determined by the `SIMD` width of our machine.
We can get this information using the `simdwidthof` function.

```mojo {doctest="guide_simd_apply"}
# How many `Float64` values can we process at once?
alias simd_width=simdwidthof[Float64]()

# Apply the move operation to all entities with a position and a velocity
world.apply[move, simd_width=simd_width](world.query[Position, Velocity]())
```
