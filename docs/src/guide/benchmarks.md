## ECS operations

TODO: Tabular overview of the runtime cost of typical ECS operations.
See Arche's [benchmarks](https://mlange-42.github.io/arche/background/benchmarks/) for an example.

## Versus Array of Structs

The plots below show the iteration time per entity in the classical Position-Velocity example.
That is, iterate all entities with components `Position` and `Velocity`, and add velocity to position:

```mojo
position.x += velocity.x
position.y += velocity.y
```

The benchmark is performed with different amounts of "payload components",
where each of them has two `Float64` fields, just like `Position` and `Velocity`.
Further, the total number of entities is varied from 100 to 1 million.

Note that the benchmarks run in the Github CI, 
which uses very powerful hardware.
Particularly, the processors have 256MB of cache.
On a laptop or desktop computer with typically much less cache,
LarecsðŸŒ² will outperform AoS for everything but the smallest setups.
