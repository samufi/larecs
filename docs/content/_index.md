# Larecs

Larecs is a performance-oriented archetype-based ECS for Mojo.

Larecs is based on the ECS [Arche](https://github.com/mlange-42/arche), implemented in the Go programming language.

Larecs is still under construction, so the API might change in future versions. It can, however, already be used for 
testing purposes.
