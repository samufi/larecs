#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run_tests.sh — Build and run Mojo test files with AddressSanitizer enabled.
#
# Usage:
#   ./test/run_tests.sh <test_directory>   # Run all test_*.mojo files in a directory
#   ./test/run_tests.sh <test_file.mojo>   # Run a single test file
#
# Each test file is compiled with debug info, all assertions, and AddressSanitizer,
# then executed via `script` so it runs in a PTY. This preserves ASAN's colored
# output while also capturing it to check for ASAN error messages.
#
# Binaries are placed in .build/ and removed after each test run.
# The script exits with code 1 if any test fails to build, exits non-zero,
# or produces output containing both "ERROR:" and "AddressSanitizer".
#
# To disable AddressSanitizer for a specific test file, add the following
# comment anywhere in that file:
#
#   # SKIP_ASAN
#
set -e
