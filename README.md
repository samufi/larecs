# LarecsðŸŒ² â€“ Lightweight archetype-based ECS

LarecsðŸŒ² is a performance-oriented archetype-based ECS for [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo)ðŸ”¥. 
It is based on the ECS [Arche](https://github.com/mlange-42/arche), implemented in the Go programming language. The package is still under construction, so be aware that the API might change in future versions.


## Features

- Clean and simple API
- High performance due to archetypes and Mojo's compile-time programming
- Support for SIMD via a [`vectorize`](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/algorithm/functional/vectorize/)-like syntax
- Compile-time checks thanks to usage of parameters
- Native support for [resources](https://mlange-42.github.io/arche/guide/resources/)
- Tested and benchmarked
- No external dependencies
- More features coming soon... 


## Installation

This package is written in and for [Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started)ðŸ”¥, which needs to be installed in order to compile, test, or use the software. You can build LarecsðŸŒ² as a package as follows:

1. Clone the repository / download the files.
2. Navigate to the `src/` subfolder.
3. Execute `mojo package larecs`.
4. Move the newly created file `larecs.mojopkg` to your project's source directory.

### Include source directly for compiler and language server

To access the source while debugging and to adjust the LarecsðŸŒ² 
source code, you can include it into run commands of your own
projects as follows:

```
mojo run -I "path/to/larecs/src" example.mojo
```

To let VSCode and the language server know of LarecsðŸŒ², include it as follows:

1. Go to VSCode's `File -> Preferences -> Settings` page.
2. Go to the `Extensions -> Mojo` section.
3. Look for the setting `Lsp: Include Dirs`.
4. Click on `add item` and insert the path to the `src/` subdirectory.

## Usage

Refer to the [API docs](https://samufi.github.io/larecs/) for details
on how to use LarecsðŸŒ². 

Below there is a simple example covering the most important functionality.
Have a look at the `examples` subdirectory for more elaborate examples. 

```python
# Import the package
from larecs import World, Resources


# Define components
@value
struct Position:
    var x: Float64
    var y: Float64


@value
struct IsStatic:
    pass


@value
struct Velocity:
    var x: Float64
    var y: Float64


# Run the ECS
fn main() raises:
    # Create a world, list all components that will / may be used
    # Add resources (here, we do not need any)
    world = World[Position, Velocity, IsStatic](Resources())

    for _ in range(100):
        # Add an entity. The returned value is the
        # entity's ID, which can be used to access the entity later
        entity = world.add_entity(Position(0, 0), IsStatic())

        # For example, we may want to change the entity's position
        world.get[Position](entity).x = 2

        # Or we may want to replace the IsStatic component
        # of the entity by a Velocity component
        world.replace[IsStatic]().by(Velocity(2, 2), entity=entity)

    # We can query entities with specific components
    for entity in world.query[Position, Velocity]():
        # use get_ptr to get a pointer to a specific component
        position = entity.get_ptr[Position]()

        # use get to get a reference / copy of a specific component
        velocity = entity.get[Velocity]()

        position[].x += velocity.x
        position[].y += velocity.y
```


## Limitations

### Only trivial types can be components

LarecsðŸŒ² currently only supports trivial types as components, i.e., structs 
that have a fixed size in memory. Using types with heap-allocated memory will
result in memory leaks and / or undefined behaviour, and as of now there is no
good way to enforce that only compatible types are used. 
Hence, it is up to the user to take care of this.

Note that using types with heap-allocated memory is typically a bad idea for
ECS and should be avoided anyway.

### Inefficient dictionary for first-time archetype lookup

Due to a [bug](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/3781) in MojoðŸ”¥, LarecsðŸŒ² uses a very 
inefficient dict implementation for first-time archetype lookup. 
As long as the number of component combinations (archetypes) is limited,
this issue is insignificant. The problem will be fixed as soon as possible.

## Next steps

The goal of LarecsðŸŒ² is to provide a user-friendly ECS with maximal efficiency. 
In the near future, LarecsðŸŒ² will take the following steps:
- [ ] Add further useful functionality for working with multiple entities at once, e.g. via [batches](https://mlange-42.github.io/arche/guide/batch-ops/index.html).
- [ ] Improve the documentation
- [ ] Add built-in support for [event systems](https://mlange-42.github.io/arche/guide/events/index.html).
- [x] Add further options to filter entities (e.g. "does not have component").
- [ ] Add possibilities for parallel execution
- [ ] Add GPU support 
- [ ] Improve the usability by switching to value unpacking in queries as soon as this is available in MojoðŸ”¥.
- [ ] Fix the dictionary issue mentioned above.
- [ ] Add a versioning scheme.
